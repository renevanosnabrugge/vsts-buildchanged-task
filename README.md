# Description

This task enables you to check if a build has changed since the last time it has succesfully built. Sometimes a build did not change, but is scheduled for every night. Building is not a big deal, but you do not want 
to trigger a new release when the build did not change. This task enables you to check if a build changed by checking if the CommitID or changeset ID that triggered it is different than the last succesful build before.
You can set an outut variable which contains a true or false, that you can use in subsequent tasks. For example setting a build tag, or performing another task.

This task supports:

 * Check if build changed
 * Setting an output variable with the value 
  
Use the OAuth token in the build pipeline to access the TFS/VSTS REST API
 
Find the task in the Utility category of Build

# Known issues
 * None (yet)
